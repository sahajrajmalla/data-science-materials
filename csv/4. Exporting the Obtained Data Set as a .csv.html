<p>To proceed with the next step towards the solution of our exercise, you’ll have to export the obtained data set as a *.csv file. </p><p>To do that, use the same Notebook file you’ve used in this section so far, and execute the following line of code.</p><p><code>model.predicted_outputs().to_csv(‘Absenteeism_predictions.csv', index = False)</code></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><em>Note: The code above would create a *.csv file in the same folder where you have stored the ‘Absenteeism_data.csv’ and ‘Absenteeism Exercise – Integration.ipynb’ </em>files. Should you prefer to store the file in another folder, e.g. in a folder called ‘Test’ on drive D, please indicate the path according to the following example. </p><p><code>model.predicted_outputs().to_csv('D:/Test/Absenteeism_predictions.csv', index = False) </code></p><p> </p><p>In the next lecture, we will load the data from this *.csv file and will analyse it in Tableau to obtain beautiful visualizations.</p>
